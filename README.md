The abstract bitmap drawer is a flash-based abstract art generator, using random number generation to determine the outcome of each pass of the routine.  The information is slowly "painted" to a bitmap object, and the routine can be stopped at any point by the user and the current image saved.

This is the first pass at this code, so it is VERY rough.  More of a sketch than a properly commented program.  Also, the code is contained within the .fla file.  The .as file is only here at the moment for easy viewing of the code in a browser.  I will eventually break all the subroutines out into proper classes, but my main goal is to port the whole thing over to HTML5 + JavaScript before I go too crazy cleaning it up, as I can do both in a single process.
